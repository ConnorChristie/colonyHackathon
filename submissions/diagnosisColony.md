# colonyDiagnosis: Crowdsourcing Time & Funds for Solving Medical Mysteries

## Project Description
What inspired me to come up with this idea was hearing stories about rare diseases that only a handful of people have in the world without there being any research or doctors knowing anything about the condition. This project aims to bring together the symptoms of unseen diseases with scientists, researchers, doctors, and the general public to find out more and reward them for their work in discovering more about the condition.

Not only could this be applicable to rare diseases, this could provide insight on general diseases such as the flu to neighboring countries that don't have direct access to medical professionals.

### Possible Applications
* Someone with a rare unknown condition may post their story and allow contributions of both funds and knowledge to help them.
* A group or organization may come together to share a larger story about ebola for example, where research can be funded and crowdsourced to learn more about the issues.
* Petition monetary support for possible organ donors or artificial limbs.
